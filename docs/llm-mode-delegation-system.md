## Overview

The Little Phil Ignite project uses a **four-tier LLM expert team system** that provides comprehensive coverage across all aspects of software development:

- **Architect/CTO Mode**: Strategic oversight, planning, and team orchestration
- **Konverter Coder Mode**: Feature implementation and standard development
- **Debugger Specialist Mode**: Complex issue resolution and system optimization
